The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
It went like this:
The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days"
You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood

D'you think the end of the world is coming?
The preacher man says it's the end of time... he says that America's rivers are going dry.
The interest is up, the stock market's down. You guys have to be careful walking around here this late at night
Spare change?
this... - no we don't ma'am, I'm sorry - this this this is the perfect place to get jumped.
But d'you think the end of the world is coming?
No. So says the preacher man but... I don't go by what he says.
Indeed.

Well... Where are you coming from?
Well yeah, I um
Well, I don't like the way the country is ran, don't you know.
That's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem,
The government, the... th- th- American government
they're sneaky,
they're, they're, they're very deceitful,
they're liars,
they're cheats,
they're ripoffs,
I mean the American government is one systematic government that... that nobody can trust.
I don't trust them myself.
And how long've you been writing for?
Huh?
How long have you been writing for?
Since I was four.
Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions?
Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do open-mics, absolutely
What kind of reactions do you get?
Usually people that are in agreement with what I'm saying.
I think we overheard you talking with people before about a speeding ticket?
That's accurate.
Do you mind telling us that story?
Yes absolutely, I don't mind telling you that story.
Um I went to court today for a speeding ticket,
and I told the judge, um...
Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good. I'm going to tell you about this one time and one time only.
I says, I'm here to pay a speeding ticket.
Not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour.
I says I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket.
And I'm here to get my funds out of the way and get the fuck to work.
The judge says you can't come in here and disrespect my court room, you're in contempt of court.
I told the judge if that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you.
I says why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once in your life and listen, I'm not going to take your shit.
I says I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket.
So I walk up to the god damn bench and I give him my $25.
And I says here's my money and I am leaving!
And I get up to walk away.
But before I leave I turn to the judge and I say...
Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge "I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you."
If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it?
Yes they would.
And the judge says "Yeah, you have a point,"
He goes "You don't need to get loud." Don't get loud, I says!, I've got every right to get loud!!
I says, You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it.
You think you're God because you have a robe and you can put people up the goddamn river for 20 years?
Well you're not. And I left it at that
Did you walk away?
Yes I did.
I don't like the judicial system.
I don't like the government system.
I don't like the police.
I don't like anything that has to do with this country's government.
I just don't like it.
They're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats.
They rip the people off.
That's the American government for you.
America is a third-world country, and people don't recognise it.
And I think that that's pretty god damn sad. That they don't recognise their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slum.
Well... Do you have any weapons?
Yes, I do.
I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun. I own a regular hunting rifle.
I own a 9mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle...
Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse?
No way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse.
Like I said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it stands
What do you think this country's going to look like in 2003?
Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question.
Because... I haven't even got a mind that's that...that inhumane.
Are you ready for what's coming?
Ready as I'll ever be.
Most people aren't.
There's a little saying... Dates back for generations...
Go on...
Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground.
People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of it.
Would you mind reciting one of your poems?
Not at all, I don't see why... I don't see why I couldn't.
There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
It's not state of the art, it's a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease
To brainwash the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating and sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying
To attack someone's mind is a social disorder
The constitution, the government, martial law order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as your back is turned treason is planned
When every good thing's laid to rest
By the governments hate, by the constitution and their lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their knives
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all of our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
But it only happens in your mind
The rats in the cellar you know who you are...
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay...
Thank you for your time.

At the tone... 3 hours, 21 minutes; coordinated universal time
prepared in innocence to meet our king of glory
And so we have this
You have it in your secret windows
And you're understanding to understand it and to bring it forth
It takes minute detail
It takes a holy life
It takes emotions
It takes dedication
It takes dedication
It takes a death
And only God can allow it
And you couldn't do it if you're not the seed of God
And so the path through the great corridors
These are corridors unto his perfection
That is which the prophet and the Urim and Thummim has penetrated
That through this great sea of blackness
That I penetrated through these corridors
And I went through that last segment
Where I went through these dark serpentines
I passed through that corridor
Where they sat, where they are
And when you penetrate to the most high God
You will believe you are mad
You will believe you've gone insane
But I tell you if you follow the secret window
And you die to the ego nature
You will penetrate this darkness
Oh yes there's many a man or woman
That's been put in the insane asylum
When this has happened to them
And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane
But they saw something that's real
And they see it when they're on drugs
The only thing is they see it
Not through the light of God, and the way I show you
I show you to see it through the light of God
And the understanding of God
Because when you see the face of God, you will die
And there will be nothing left of you
Except the God-man, the God-woman
The heavenly man, the heavenly woman
The heavenly child
There'll be prayer on your lips day and night
There'll be a song of jubilee waiting for your king
There will be nothing you will not be be looking for in this world
Except in for your god
This is all a dream
A dream in death
And so I went through that window
And the tower of hell and the great serpentines of the highest order
And I went through that when I showed you chart #3
The question is asked and learned and someone who can turn this _ of this horrible _ of my _
All infront of me can now ask me a question
You need to ask, from the right _ or the right _ out of Urim and Thurrim
I can give you unspoken words that's never been spoken, it's not in your bible
Yet, it does clarify what is spoken in the bible...

It was Coney Island, they called Coney Island the playground of the world.
There was no place like it, in the whole world, like Coney Island when I was a youngster.
No place in the world like it, and it was so fabulous. Now it's shrunk down to almost nothing, you see.
And, uh, I still remember in my mind how things used to be, and... uh, you know, I feel very bad.
But people from all over the world came here... from all over the world...
It was the playground they called it the playground of the world, over here.
Anyways, you see, I... uh... you know...
I even got, when I was very small, I even got lost at Coney Island, but they found me... on the... on the beach.
And we used to sleep on the beach here, sleep overnight..they don't do that anymore. Things changed... you see.
They don't sleep anymore on the beach.

What'll we do with the baby-o?
What'll we do with the baby?
What'll we do with the baby-o?
Wrap him up in a tablecloth
Throw him up in the old hayloft
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o
Every time the baby grins
Give my baby another bottle of gin
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o
Every time the baby cries
Stick my finger in the babies eyes
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o
Be careful, my friend
He told me, if you want we will play
He told me, if you want we will play
Be careful, my friend, my friend
With the feet is like that. How how? Like that
The good king ...
King Dagobert ...
King Dagobert put his pants backwards but c'ètait an idiot
CoCoCo the monkey, early yesterday, the tot in her small cage, he told me, if you want we will play
Be careful, my friend, my friend, balalalalalala
Dagobert King took a stand upside down
We sing a little Titanic: ground floor falalala
